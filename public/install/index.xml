      <description>Installation Assumptions This is a install guide for the common human, who has just learned that she wants to set up and email server. She know nothing about anything related to setting up a mail server and only has a domain name and couple of bucks (&amp;lt;$10) in her hand.
We will use those $10 to do some really cool things:
 Buy a small VPS (with both ipv4 and ipv6) Buy a secondary DNS provider Set up AnsiMail on the server  General Information Hosting your own email is not going to be free.</description>
